# Flutter utils by [@mitryp](https://github.com/mitryp)

The packages in `/packages` here contain the utilities I use throughout my projects combined in one
monorepository.

Table of contents:

1. [`test_utils`] - a bundle of utils for speeding up test writing;
2. [`material_widgets`] - a bundle of custom Material widgets;
